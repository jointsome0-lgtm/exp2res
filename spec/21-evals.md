## §21. Evals

The `## §21.N` headings below are the stable eval identities: issues, the Decision Log, `tests/coverage_map.toml`, and `tests/acceptance_ledger.toml` cite them, and they are never renumbered. Each eval's Given/When/Then case body lives under its ID in the authored canon artifact [`spec/21-evals-cases.toml`](21-evals-cases.toml); every artifact case is normative acceptance — reviewed spec text with the same authority as this file, never a projection of implementation code. An `Enforces` line under a heading names the rules that eval enforces and mirrors the artifact's `enforces` value. A new eval adds its stable heading here, its case in the artifact, and its coverage-map row; `scripts/check_eval_cases.py` validates in offline CI that the headings here, the artifact's cases, and `tests/coverage_map.toml` correspond one-to-one, and that this file carries no fenced case bodies.
